- The ship sails to another island, where they find a pool of water that turns anything into gold. They also discover the remains of Lord Restimar, one of the missing lords, who died after throwing his sword into the pool. Caspian claims the sword as part of his quest.
- The next island they visit is inhabited by invisible creatures called Dufflepuds, who are under the spell of a magician named Coriakin. With Lucy's help, they break the spell and learn that Coriakin is actually another missing lord, who was sent by Aslan to guide and teach the Dufflepuds.
- The ship reaches the Island Where Dreams Come True, also known as the Dark Island. There they rescue Lord Rhoop, another missing lord, who has been tormented by his nightmares for years. They also encounter a dark cloud that tries to lure them with their deepest desires, but they escape with Aslan's guidance.
- The next stop is Ramandu's Island, where they meet an old man named Ramandu and his daughter Lilliandil. Ramandu reveals that he is a retired star who is gradually regaining his youth by eating a fireberry every day. He also tells them that they need to place the seven swords of the seven lords at Aslan's Table on the island to break an evil enchantment that covers the eastern seas.
- The crew realizes that they have six swords, including the one that Caspian took from Miraz in the previous book. They decide to sail to the last island where Lord Octesian was last seen, hoping to find his sword. However, they encounter a sea serpent that attacks the ship and tries to crush it.
- They manage to fend off the sea serpent with their swords and arrows, but Eustace falls overboard and is rescued by Reepicheep. They reach the last island and find a group of men who have been turned into dumb beasts by a mysterious lady. They also find Lord Octesian's sword and his arm bracelet on one of the beasts.
- They return to Ramandu's Island and place the seven swords on Aslan's Table. The enchantment is lifted and a new star appears in the sky. Ramandu tells them that it is his daughter Lilliandil, who has ascended to her true form as a star. He also tells them that Aslan's Country lies beyond the end of the world, where they can find a way back to their own world.
- Caspian decides to sail to the end of the world with Reepicheep, who has always dreamed of reaching Aslan's Country. Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace decide to join them as well. They leave behind Lord Drinian and some of the crew to guard Ramandu's Island and wait for their return.
- They reach a sea of lilies and see a bright light on the horizon. They row towards it in a small boat and meet Aslan himself, who appears as a lamb. He tells them that they have reached his country and that they can enter it if they wish.
- Reepicheep bids farewell to his friends and sails his boat over the edge of the world into Aslan's Country. Aslan tells Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace that they must return to their own world and that they will never come back to Narnia again. He also tells Caspian that he must go back to Narnia and rule his kingdom well.
