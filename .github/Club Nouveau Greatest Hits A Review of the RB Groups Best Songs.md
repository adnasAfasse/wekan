## Lean on Me
 
Lean on Me is arguably Club Nouveau's most famous song, and one of the most successful covers of all time. The song was originally written and recorded by Bill Withers in 1972, and it became a classic soul anthem about friendship and support. Club Nouveau's version added a contemporary twist to the song, with synthesizers, drum machines, and rap vocals. The result was a catchy and upbeat rendition that appealed to a wider audience and earned them a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1987.
 
Lean on Me is a song that can uplift your mood and inspire you to help others. The lyrics are simple but powerful, conveying a message of solidarity and compassion. The chorus goes: "Lean on me, when you're not strong / And I'll be your friend / I'll help you carry on / For it won't be long / 'Til I'm gonna need / Somebody to lean on". The song reminds us that we all need someone to lean on sometimes, and that we should be there for each other in times of need.

Jealousy is a song that can resonate with anyone who has experienced or witnessed jealousy in a relationship. The song warns us about the dangers of letting jealousy take over our emotions and actions, and how it can ruin a good thing. The song also encourages us to communicate with our partner and trust them, instead of letting our insecurities get the best of us.
 
## Why You Treat Me So Bad
 
Why You Treat Me So Bad is another popular song by Club Nouveau, which was released as their second single in 1987. The song is about a person who is unhappy with their partner's behavior, and who questions why they treat them so badly. The song features a catchy chorus that goes: "Why you treat me so bad? / You know I love you / How come you do me like you do?". The verses describe how the person feels hurt and confused by their partner's actions, such as lying, cheating, or ignoring them.
 
Why You Treat Me So Bad is a song that can relate to anyone who has felt mistreated or unappreciated by their partner.
